## Business Partners: The Real Stakes

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 40px; margin: 30px 0;">

<div>
<h3 style="color: #7c3aed;">What they provide</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">
<li>Content, access to systems, business context</li>
<li>Feedback on deliverables</li>
<li>Final evaluation of your work</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3 style="color: #15803d;">What they receive</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">
<li>Q3 content calendar (May-August 2026)</li>
<li>3+ weeks of publication-ready content</li>
<li>Working automation system</li>
<li>Documentation and training</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px; color: #dc2626; margin-top: 30px;">
<strong>Real stakes. Your business partner is counting on you.</strong>
</div>

Note:
These are real stakes. Your business partner is counting on you. Treat this like a professional engagement. Their evaluation determines part of your grade.

---

## How We'll Get There: Course Structure

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 40px; margin: 30px 0;">

<div>
<h3>28 sessions (14 weeks × 2)</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
<strong>Each 80-minute session:</strong><br>
• 15 min: Deliverable review & debug<br>
• 20 min: New concept + live demo<br>
• 40 min: Hands-on work<br>
• 5 min: Preview next session
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Outside of Class</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
<strong>Pre-class:</strong> Video walkthroughs, playbook readings<br><br>
<strong>Outside class:</strong> Team meetings 1× per week
</p>
</div>

</div>

Note:
This is a hands-on course. You'll spend most of your time building, not listening to lectures. The 15-minute deliverable review is critical - you learn from seeing each other's work.

---

## The Unit Journey: Your Roadmap

<div style="font-size: 16px;">

| Weeks | Unit | Focus | What You'll Build | Periodic Table Elements |
|-------|------|-------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 1-2 | Foundations & Simple RAG | Understand AI basics | Custom GPT, discovery interview | Pr, Lg, Em, Rg |
| 3-4 | Embeddings & Multi-Modal | Semantic analysis | Semantic audit, pillar content | Em, Vx, Mm |
| 5-6 | Workflows & Knowledge | Automation systems | N8N workflows, Qdrant setup | Fw, Vx, Em |
| 7-8 | Agents & RAG Integration | Production RAG | LibreChat + MCP + Qdrant | Ag, Rg, Fc, Vx |
| 9-10 | Multi-Agent & Visual | Advanced systems | Multi-agent pipeline, video | Ma, Mm, Th |
| 11-14 | Production & Handoff | Real delivery | 3+ weeks content, docs, training | All elements |

</div>

Note:
We'll explain the periodic table in a minute, but this is the progression. You start with foundations, build up to complex multi-agent systems, then go into production mode delivering real content. Each unit builds on the previous.

---

## The Unit Journey: How It Connects

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin: 30px 0;">

**Weeks 1-2:** Learn the primitives (Pr, Lg, Em) → Build simple RAG → Meet your business partner

**Weeks 3-4:** Master embeddings & semantic analysis → Audit partner content → Create pillar content

**Weeks 5-6:** Build workflows in N8N → Set up vector database → Automate content ingestion

**Weeks 7-8:** Connect everything with agents → Full RAG system → Voice-matched content generation

**Weeks 9-10:** Add multi-agent coordination → Generate visual/video content → Complete calendar

**Weeks 11-14:** Produce 3+ weeks of content → Document & train → Handoff to partner

</div>

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; color: #7c3aed; margin-top: 30px;">
<strong>Each step builds toward the final deliverables</strong>
</div>

Note:
This is how it all connects. By the end, you'll have built a complete system that automatically generates content for your business partner using everything you've learned.

---

## Grading: The GWC Framework

<div style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">

**Three dimensions (inspired by Traction/EOS):**

**Get it:** Do you understand the concepts?
- In-class quiz performance (we'll have quick comprehension checks)
- Teammates rate: "Do they get it? Do they add value?"

**Want it:** Are you engaged and contributing?
- Completes deliverables on time
- Participates actively in class
- Shows initiative and ownership

**Capacity:** Can you execute the skills?
- Deliverables meet quality standards
- Technical implementation works
- Applies feedback effectively

</div>

Note:
You're rated weekly on these three dimensions: +, +/-, or -. This isn't about perfection - it's about effort, engagement, and growth. I'm looking for consistent progress.

---

## Pass Requirements

**To pass SSC 493, you must meet ALL of these:**

1. ✅ **12 of 14 weekly deliverables completed** (85%)
2. ✅ **GWC rating average ≥ +/-** (meets expectations)
3. ✅ **Peer evaluation average ≥ 3/5**
4. ✅ **Business partner rating ≥ "Meets expectations"**
5. ✅ **Final presentation attendance**

**Note:** This is Pass/No Pass - no letter grades

Note:
The bar is clear. Show up, do the work, collaborate well, deliver value to your business partner. That's how you pass. You can miss 2 deliverables and still pass.

---

## Now Let's Talk About HOW

**The AI Periodic Table: Your Framework for Understanding**

Note:
Now that you know WHAT you're building and HOW you'll be graded, let's talk about the organizing framework that will guide everything we do this semester.

---

## The Challenge

<div class="mermaid" style="transform: scale(0.85);">
mindmap
  root((AI<br/>Chaos))
    Agents
      Multi-Agent
      Thinking Models
    RAG
      Vector DBs
      Embeddings
    Content
      Multi-modal
      Guardrails
    Tools
      Function Calling
      Frameworks
    Models
      LLMs
      Small Models
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px; margin: 30px 0; color: #6b7280;">
**...and you're just supposed to know how it all fits together?**
</div>

Note:
This is the problem we're solving. The AI landscape is overwhelming. Everyone's talking about these terms, but there's no clear organizing structure.

---

## The AI Periodic Table

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px auto;">
<iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/uXjVGR6Ig2I=/?embedMode=view_only_without_ui&moveToViewport=-521,-360,940,687&embedId=946427147971" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allow="fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px; margin: 20px 0;">
**What if we could organize AI like chemistry organizes the elements?**
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; color: #6b7280;">
<a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVGR6Ig2I=/?share_link_id=193744778638" target="_blank">Open full board in new tab →</a>
</div>

Note:
Just like chemistry has the periodic table to organize elements into families with predictable properties, we're going to use a framework to organize all AI technologies. The Miro board above is interactive - you can zoom and pan. I'll walk you through the structure now.

---

## The 4 Rows

<div style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 2; margin: 40px 0;">

1. **Primitives** - The atomic elements (can't break them down further)

2. **Compositions** - Combining primitives into systems

3. **Deployment** - Putting systems into production

4. **Emerging** - Cutting-edge technologies (rapidly evolving)

</div>

Note:
These are the 4 rows. Row 1 is foundational - everything else builds from these. Row 2 combines them. Row 3 deploys them. Row 4 is what's cutting edge right now.

---

## The 5 Families (Columns)

<div style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 2; margin: 40px 0;">

- **G1: Reactive** - Making things happen (control → action → autonomy)

- **G2: Retrieval** - Finding and remembering (encode → store → internalize)

- **G3: Orchestration** - Coordinating multiple pieces

- **G4: Validation** - Quality control and safety

- **G5: Models** - The foundation everything reacts around

</div>

Note:
These are the 5 families or groups. Elements in the same family have similar properties but get more powerful as you go down the rows. This framework will be your constant reference point. Every session, we'll say "Today we're covering Rg (RAG), which sits in row 2 (compositions), family 3 (orchestration)."

---

## Row 1: Primitives

<div style="font-size: 18px;">

| Element | Name | What It Is |
|---------|------|------------|
| **Pr** | Prompts | Instructions you give to AI |
| **Em** | Embeddings | Numerical representations of meaning |
| **Lg** | Large Language Models | The models themselves (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) |

<div style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px; color: #7c3aed;">
Everything else in AI is built from combining these three primitives.
</div>

</div>

Note:
These are foundational. You'll work with prompts every single day. Embeddings are how AI understands semantic meaning. LLMs are the models that power everything. Master these, and you can understand any AI system.

---

## Row 2: Compositions

<div style="font-size: 16px;">

| Element | Name | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Fc** | Function Calling | AI calls external tools (APIs, databases) |
| **Vx** | Vector Databases | Storage for semantic search |
| **Rg** | RAG | Retrieval Augmented Generation - AI with "memory" |
| **Gr** | Guardrails | Quality control and safety filters |
| **Mm** | Multi-modal | Processing text, images, audio, video |

</div>

Note:
This is where things get practical. RAG lets AI access your company's knowledge. Vector databases store embeddings for fast semantic search. You'll build all of these this semester.

---

## Row 3: Deployment

<div style="font-size: 16px;">

| Element | Name | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Ag** | Agents | Think-act-observe loops, autonomous AI |
| **Ft** | Fine-Tuning | Training models on your specific data |
| **Fw** | Frameworks | Platforms like N8N for orchestration |
| **Rt** | Red Teaming | Adversarial testing to find vulnerabilities |
| **Sm** | Small Models | Fast, cheap, specialized models |

</div>

Note:
Deployment is where theory becomes practice. You'll build agents that run automatically. You'll use N8N to orchestrate workflows. This is production-ready AI.

---

## Row 4: Emerging

<div style="font-size: 16px;">

| Element | Name | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Ma** | Multi-Agent | Specialized AIs working together |
| **Sy** | Synthetic Data | Using AI to generate training data |
| **In** | Interpretability | Understanding why AI makes decisions |
| **Th** | Thinking Models | Models that reason step-by-step |

</div>

Note:
This row is evolving fastest. Multi-agent systems are becoming standard. Thinking models (like OpenAI's o1) spend time reasoning before answering. You'll experiment with these.

---

## The Reactive Family (G1)

**Making things happen - from control to autonomy**

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 20px; margin: 40px 0; font-size: 16px;">

<div style="background: #f0f9ff; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Pr (Prompts)</strong><br>
Row 1: Primitives<br>
<em>You control output</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #dbeafe; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Fc (Function Calling)</strong><br>
Row 2: Compositions<br>
<em>AI takes actions</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #bfdbfe; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Ag (Agents)</strong><br>
Row 3: Deployment<br>
<em>AI works autonomously</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #93c5fd; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Ma (Multi-Agent)</strong><br>
Row 4: Emerging<br>
<em>AIs coordinate together</em>
</div>

</div>

**The progression:** Control → Action → Autonomy → Coordination

Note:
Notice the progression. Prompts are you controlling AI. Function calling is AI taking actions with tools. Agents are AI working autonomously toward goals. Multi-agent is multiple AIs coordinating to solve complex problems. This is the reactive family.

---

## The Retrieval Family (G2)

**Finding and remembering - four timescales of memory**

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 20px; margin: 40px 0; font-size: 16px;">

<div style="background: #f0fdf4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Em (Embeddings)</strong><br>
Row 1: Primitives<br>
<em>Encode meaning</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #dcfce7; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Vx (Vector DBs)</strong><br>
Row 2: Compositions<br>
<em>Store for search</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #bbf7d0; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Ft (Fine-Tuning)</strong><br>
Row 3: Deployment<br>
<em>Bake into model</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #86efac; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Sy (Synthetic Data)</strong><br>
Row 4: Emerging<br>
<em>Generate training data</em>
</div>

</div>

**The progression:** Encode → Store → Internalize → Generate

Note:
Embeddings encode meaning as numbers. Vector databases store those embeddings for fast search. Fine-tuning bakes knowledge directly into model weights. Synthetic data uses AI to create training examples. Four ways AI "remembers" and learns.

---

## The Orchestration Family (G3)

**Coordinating multiple pieces**

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 30px; margin: 40px 0; font-size: 18px;">

<div style="background: #fef3c7; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Rg (RAG)</strong><br>
Row 2: Compositions<br>
<em>Retrieve + Generate</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #fde047; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Fw (Frameworks)</strong><br>
Row 3: Deployment<br>
<em>Orchestration platforms</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #e5e7eb; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; opacity: 0.5;">
<strong>?</strong><br>
Row 4: Emerging<br>
<em>Gap in the table</em>
</div>

</div>

**The progression:** Combine elements → Orchestrate workflows → Future paradigm

Note:
RAG orchestrates embeddings, vector DBs, prompts, and LLMs together. Frameworks like N8N tie everything together. Row 4 has a gap - there's no clear emerging orchestration paradigm yet. What do you think will fill it?

---

## The Validation Family (G4)

**Quality control and safety**

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 30px; margin: 40px 0; font-size: 18px;">

<div style="background: #fee2e2; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Gr (Guardrails)</strong><br>
Row 2: Compositions<br>
<em>Runtime safety filters</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #fecaca; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Rt (Red Teaming)</strong><br>
Row 3: Deployment<br>
<em>Adversarial testing</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #fca5a5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>In (Interpretability)</strong><br>
Row 4: Emerging<br>
<em>Understand AI decisions</em>
</div>

</div>

**The progression:** Filter output → Test security → Understand reasoning

Note:
Guardrails ensure AI doesn't output garbage or leak info. Red teaming tries to break the AI (jailbreaks, prompt injection). Interpretability peers inside the black box to understand why AI makes decisions. These are your safety nets.

---

## The Models Family (G5)

**The foundation everything reacts around**

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 20px; margin: 40px 0; font-size: 16px;">

<div style="background: #ede9fe; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Lg (Large Models)</strong><br>
Row 1: Primitives<br>
<em>ChatGPT, Claude, etc.</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #ddd6fe; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Mm (Multi-modal)</strong><br>
Row 2: Compositions<br>
<em>Text + Image + Audio</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #c4b5fd; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Sm (Small Models)</strong><br>
Row 3: Deployment<br>
<em>Fast, cheap, specialized</em>
</div>

<div style="background: #a78bfa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Th (Thinking Models)</strong><br>
Row 4: Emerging<br>
<em>Reason step-by-step</em>
</div>

</div>

**The progression:** General purpose → Multi-format → Optimized → Reasoning

Note:
Models are like the noble gases in chemistry - stable foundations that everything else reacts around. Large models are general purpose. Multi-modal handles different formats. Small models are optimized for speed/cost. Thinking models spend time reasoning.

---

## Example: Production RAG System

**Let's see how elements combine to create a real AI system**

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin: 30px 0;">

**The Pattern:**
1. **Em** (Embeddings) - Convert your documents to vectors
2. **Vx** (Vector Database) - Store embeddings in Qdrant
3. **Rg** (RAG) - User asks question → retrieve relevant docs → augment prompt
4. **Lg** (LLM) - Generate answer grounded in your data
5. **Gr** (Guardrails) - Wrap in safety filters

</div>

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px; color: #7c3aed; margin-top: 40px;">
That's 5 elements working together = production AI chatbot
</div>

Note:
This is what you'll build. By Week 8, your team will have a RAG system connected to a business partner's content. You'll use embeddings, vector databases, RAG, LLMs, and guardrails all working together.

---

## Example: Agentic Loop

**Another common pattern - agents that DO things**

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin: 30px 0;">

**The Goal:** Book me a flight to Tokyo next month under $800

**The Pattern:**
1. **Ag** (Agent) - Breaks goal into steps (search flights → check calendar → compare prices → book)
2. **Fc** (Function Calling) - Calls external APIs (flight search, calendar, payment)
3. **Observe** - Gets results, decides next action
4. **Fw** (Framework) - N8N orchestrates the whole loop

</div>

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px; color: #7c3aed; margin-top: 40px;">
Think. Act. Observe. Repeat until goal achieved.
</div>

Note:
This is what makes agents powerful. They don't just respond - they plan, take action, observe results, and keep going until the goal is met. You'll build multi-agent systems that work like this.

---

## Course Mapping to Periodic Table

**By the end of this course, you'll have hands-on experience with:**

- **Row 1 (Primitives):** Pr, Em, Lg
- **Row 2 (Compositions):** Rg, Vx, Mm, Fc, Gr
- **Row 3 (Deployment):** Ag, Fw, Sm
- **Row 4 (Emerging):** Ma, Th

<div style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px; color: #15803d;">
That's 11+ elements of the AI Periodic Table
</div>

Note:
You'll cover most of the table. Every session references this framework so you always know where you are in the AI landscape.

---

## Hands-On: PrinciplesYou Assessment

Welcome to SSC 493. Let's build some AI systems.
</div>

Note:
Excited to have you here. This is going to be a challenging, hands-on, rewarding semester. You're going to build real systems and create real business value.
