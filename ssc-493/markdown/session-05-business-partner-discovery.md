## Welcome, Business Partners!

**Session 5: Business Partner Discovery**

<div style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.8; margin: 40px 0;">

Today marks the beginning of your semester project.

You'll meet your team, meet your business partner, and start building real AI systems for real organizations.

</div>

<div style="background: #dbeafe; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 30px 0; font-size: 20px;">
<strong>This is client work.</strong> Professional, collaborative, consequential.
</div>

Note:
Welcome business partners to class! This is a big day - students meet their teams and business partners for the first time. Set the tone: this is real work, not a simulation. Partners are counting on students to deliver. Students are getting real-world experience. Everybody wins if we do this right.

---

## Today's Agenda

<div style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 2; margin: 40px 0;">

1. Team assignments + logistics setup
2. Project overview + partner introductions
3. Discovery interviews
4. Preview next session + wrap-up

</div>

<div style="background: #fef3c7; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 30px 0; font-size: 18px;">
<strong>Goal:</strong> Teams understand their business partner's needs, have access to collaborate, and know what they're building this semester.
</div>

Note:
Walk through the agenda. This is a logistical session, not a lecture. The bulk of time (40 min) is dedicated to discovery interviews - students listening and learning from their business partners. By the end, every team should have: (1) met their partner, (2) access to Google Drive folder, (3) understanding of what access they'll need, (4) clear picture of semester deliverables.

## Team Assignments

**Based on PrinciplesYou assessment results**

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 20px; margin: 30px 0; font-size: 16px;">

<div style="background: #dbeafe; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<h4 style="color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 10px;">Team 1 - HTSA</h4>
<p>Evan Goebel<br>Abdelmagid Bouhjila<br>Triniti Halbedel<br>Calvin Lewis</p>
</div>

<div style="background: #dcfce7; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<h4 style="color: #14532d; margin-bottom: 10px;">Team 2 - GLCF</h4>
<p>Justin Favreau<br>Asher Berhanesh<br>Rui Yang<br>Jared Evans</p>
</div>

<div style="background: #fef3c7; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<h4 style="color: #92400e; margin-bottom: 10px;">Team 3 - Medilodge</h4>
<p>Bailey Chamberlain<br>Luke Heldke<br>Daniel Johnson<br>Kyle Bargowski</p>
</div>

<div style="background: #fce7f3; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">
<h4 style="color: #831843; margin-bottom: 10px;">Team 4 - Weathervane</h4>
<p>Leah Coleman<br>Kenye Nesbitt<br>Lucie Martin<br>Nicolas Brevetti</p>
</div>

</div>

Note:
Reveal team assignments. Teams were formed based on PrinciplesYou assessment results - balanced for complementary strengths. Each team has a mix of archetypes: some execution-focused (Producers), some people-focused (Givers/Enthusiasts), some thinking-focused (Seekers/Architects). This diversity is intentional. Different perspectives make better teams. Give students a moment to find their teammates.

### Team 5 - Orange Insoles

<div style="background: #e0f2fe; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 40px auto; max-width: 400px; text-align: center;">
<h4 style="color: #0369a1; margin-bottom: 15px;">Team 5 - Orange Insoles</h4>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Cameron Ream<br>Ria Pandit<br>Samuel Parks</p>
</div>

<div style="background: #fef3c7; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 30px 0; font-size: 18px;">
<strong>Note:</strong> Owen from Orange Insoles will be joining via Zoom today.
</div>

Note:
Team 5 is a smaller team (3 members) working with Orange Insoles. Owen will be on Zoom rather than in-person. Make sure this team has a good audio setup for their discovery interview. Same expectations, just different delivery format.

---

## Logistics: Google Drive

**Your team's collaboration hub**

<div style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.8; margin: 30px 0;">

Each team has a dedicated Google Drive folder:

<ul style="margin-top: 20px;">
<li><strong>FROM partner:</strong> Brand assets, content samples, reference materials</li>
<li><strong>TO partner:</strong> Deliverables, drafts, documentation</li>
<li><strong>Team use:</strong> Discovery notes, meeting summaries, project planning</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div style="background: #dcfce7; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 30px 0; font-size: 18px;">
<strong>Action:</strong> Share your folder link with your business partner during discovery.
</div>

Note:
Google Drive is the central hub for collaboration. Each team already has a folder created. During the discovery interview, students should share the folder link with their partner. Everything flows through this folder - brand assets from the partner, deliverables to the partner, team working documents. Keep it organized from day one.

;;;

### Sharing Credentials Securely

**Use OneTimeSecret for password sharing**

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 350px; gap: 40px; align-items: center; margin: 40px 0;">

<div>
<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.8;">
<strong>How it works:</strong><br>
1. Partner creates one-time secret link<br>
2. Shares link with student team<br>
3. Link expires after one view<br>
4. Students store in team password manager
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 18px; color: #6b7280;">
<strong>Scan or visit:</strong> onetimesecret.com
</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=300x300&data=https://onetimesecret.com" alt="OneTimeSecret QR Code" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; border: 2px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 10px;">
</div>

</div>

<div style="background: #fee2e2; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; font-size: 18px;">
<strong>Never email passwords directly.</strong> Always use secure sharing methods.
</div>

Note:
Security matters. Students will need access to partner accounts (social media, website CMS, API keys). OneTimeSecret creates self-destructing secure links - share once, then it's gone. Partners: when you need to share a password, create a one-time link and send that instead of the password directly. Students: store credentials securely as soon as you receive them. We'll set up Passbolt (enterprise password manager) in a future session, but for now, OneTimeSecret handles the secure handoff.

### Partner Commitment Timeline

<div style="font-size: 18px; margin: 30px 0;">

| Week | Touchpoint | What Happens |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **3 (today)** | Discovery meeting | Teams learn your business |
| **4** | Semantic audit review | 15 min async feedback |
| **5** | Pillar content review | 20 min async feedback |
| **6** | Calendar skeleton | 15 min async feedback |
| **10** | Video samples | 15 min async feedback |
| **11-12** | Final delivery | 30 min review |
| **Finals** | Showcase | 60 min presentation |

</div>

<div style="background: #f0f9ff; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 30px 0; font-size: 18px;">
<strong>Most reviews are async</strong> - we respect your time while ensuring quality alignment.
</div>

Note:
Quick overview of partner commitment. Most touchpoints are async reviews (15-20 min). Today is the longest commitment - the discovery interview. Then periodic check-ins to ensure alignment. Final showcase during finals week. We've designed this to minimize partner time while maximizing collaboration quality. Detailed timeline is in the project plan document in your Google Drive folder.

### Detailed Project Plan

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 350px; gap: 40px; align-items: center; margin: 40px 0;">

<div>
<h3 style="font-size: 24px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Full Details in Google Drive</h3>
<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.8;">
Each team folder contains:<br><br>
<strong>Business Partner Project Plan</strong><br>
- Complete deliverable descriptions<br>
- Evaluation rubric<br>
- FAQ and expectations<br>
- Contact information
</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="background: #f3f4f6; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px;">
<p style="font-size: 18px; color: #6b7280; margin-bottom: 15px;">Check your team's<br>Google Drive folder</p>
<p style="font-size: 48px;">📁</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

Note:
The detailed project plan is in each team's Google Drive folder. It covers everything: complete deliverable descriptions, evaluation rubric (how partners will rate teams at end of semester), FAQ, and contact information. Students should read this carefully. Partners should reference it when questions come up. Today we're doing high-level overview - the document has all the details.

## Business Partner Introductions

**Meet the organizations you'll be working with**

<div style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.8; margin: 40px 0;">

5 business partners joining us today:

<ol style="margin-top: 20px;">
<li><strong>HTSA</strong></li>
<li><strong>GLCF</strong></li>
<li><strong>Medilodge</strong></li>
<li><strong>Weathervane</strong></li>
<li><strong>Orange Insoles</strong> (Owen via Zoom)</li>
</ol>

</div>

<div style="background: #f0f9ff; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 30px 0; font-size: 18px;">
<strong>Partners:</strong> Brief intro (~3 min) - who you are, what you do, who you serve
</div>

Note:
Time for partner introductions. Each partner gets ~3 minutes to introduce themselves: business overview, who they serve, what problems they solve. This is just the intro - the deep dive happens during discovery interviews. Owen from Orange Insoles is joining via Zoom. After intros, teams will break out for 40-minute discovery interviews.

## Discovery Interview Framework

**Your goal: Listen and learn**

<div style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.8; margin: 30px 0;">

**Interview Structure:**

1. **Business Context** - Who they serve, what makes them different
2. **Target Audience** - Ideal customer, pain points, where they spend time
3. **Current Content** - What exists, what's working, what's not
4. **Goals & Vision** - Magic wand question, success criteria
5. **Access & Logistics** - What you'll need, share Google Drive link

</div>

<div style="background: #f3e8ff; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; font-size: 18px; border-left: 4px solid #7c3aed;">
<strong>Pro tip:</strong> Record the meeting as a voice memo. Later we'll learn how to build Project Agents that can use these recordings.
</div>

Note:
This is the framework for your discovery interview. Structured but conversational. You're learning about their business so you can build the right thing. Key sections: business context, target audience, current content landscape, goals, and access needs. Don't skip the access conversation - you need to know what URLs, files, and credentials you'll need to do your work.

### Interview Best Practices

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 30px; margin: 40px 0; font-size: 18px;">

<div style="background: #dcfce7; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px;">
<h4 style="color: #14532d;">Do</h4>
<ul style="margin-top: 15px; line-height: 1.8;">
<li>Ask open-ended questions</li>
<li>Listen more than talk</li>
<li>Take detailed notes</li>
<li>Ask follow-up questions</li>
<li>Confirm understanding</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div style="background: #fee2e2; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px;">
<h4 style="color: #991b1b;">Don't</h4>
<ul style="margin-top: 15px; line-height: 1.8;">
<li>Propose solutions yet</li>
<li>Dominate the conversation</li>
<li>Make assumptions</li>
<li>Skip note-taking</li>
<li>Forget to ask about access</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

<div style="background: #fef3c7; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; font-size: 18px;">
<strong>Assign roles:</strong> Lead interviewer, note-taker, follow-up questions
</div>

Note:
Interview best practices. This is a listening session, not a pitch. Ask open-ended questions ("Tell me about..." not "Do you..."). Listen actively. Take good notes - you'll reference these all semester. Don't propose solutions yet - just gather context. Assign roles within your team: someone leads the questions, someone takes notes, others handle follow-ups. Everyone participates, but having clear roles prevents awkward silence or talking over each other.

;;;

### Interview Guide

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 350px; gap: 40px; align-items: center; margin: 40px 0;">

<div>
<h3 style="font-size: 24px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Sample Questions by Section</h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">
<strong>Business:</strong> "Tell me about your business - who do you serve?"<br><br>
<strong>Audience:</strong> "Who is your ideal customer?"<br><br>
<strong>Content:</strong> "What content are you creating today?"<br><br>
<strong>Goals:</strong> "What would success look like at end of semester?"<br><br>
<strong>Access:</strong> "What will we need access to?"
</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=300x300&data=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J5nj7TtiGTuEoROH6Q59LFbZd-1Sp-QcdIE5CBbC8rY/edit" alt="Interview Guide QR Code" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; border: 2px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 10px;">
<p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 16px; color: #6b7280;">Full Interview Guide<br><strong>Copy to your own Drive</strong></p>
</div>

</div>

Note:
Sample questions for each section. The full interview guide is available via QR code - scan it and make a copy in your own Google Drive. You don't have to follow it word-for-word, but it gives you a framework. Key questions to never skip: "Who is your ideal customer?" and "What will we need access to?" Without those, you'll struggle to build the right thing.

## Discovery Time

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 48px; color: #7c3aed; margin: 80px 0;">
<strong>40 Minutes</strong>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 22px; text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
Teams: Find your business partner and begin your discovery interview.
</div>

<div style="background: #f0f9ff; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 30px auto; max-width: 600px; font-size: 18px;">
<strong>Before you finish:</strong><br>
✅ Share Google Drive folder link<br>
✅ Discuss what access you'll need<br>
✅ Confirm best way to communicate<br>
✅ Exchange contact information
</div>

Note:
DISCOVERY TIME. Teams break out to interview their business partners. Circulate to observe and support. Look for: teams asking good questions, everyone participating, good notes being taken. Intervention triggers: team not asking questions (prompt with guide), partner monologuing without engagement (redirect), team seems lost (help refocus). Give 5-minute warning before reconvening. Make sure Orange Insoles team has good audio for Zoom call with Owen.

## Preview: Session 6

**Thursday: Embeddings & Semantic Search**

<div style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.8; margin: 40px 0;">

**What's coming:**
- Em (Embeddings) - second primitive element
- How text becomes numbers that represent meaning
- Your first real API calls to create embeddings
- Foundation for everything: RAG retrieval, semantic search, multi-modal

</div>

<div style="background: #f0f9ff; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 30px 0; font-size: 20px;">
<strong>We're moving from MockAPI to production APIs</strong>
</div>

Note:
Thursday we learn embeddings - the technology that powers semantic search and RAG retrieval. You'll make your first real API calls to OpenAI (not MockAPI). This is foundational - embeddings are used in RAG retrieval, semantic search, multi-modal processing, basically everything. Come ready to code.

;;;

### Before Thursday

<div style="background: #fee2e2; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 30px 0; font-size: 20px;">
<strong>Required: Complete all 8 N8N flows from Session 4</strong><br><br>
I audited workflows - not everyone finished all exercises.<br>
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE + all data structure iterations.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.8; margin: 40px 0;">

**Team deliverables (before Thursday):**
- Discovery notes in Google Drive folder
- Access request list (URLs, files, credentials needed)
- Schedule first team meeting (1 hour, outside class)

</div>

Note:
Important homework check. I audited N8N workflows from Session 4 - not everyone completed all 8 flows. You need to finish: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, plus all the data structure iterations (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, nested objects). This is prerequisite knowledge for Thursday. Team deliverables: get discovery notes into Google Drive, compile access request list, schedule first team meeting outside class.
