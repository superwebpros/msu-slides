# MSU Course Slides - RevealJS Presentation Repository

> This repository contains RevealJS-based slide presentations for Michigan State University courses. Slides are organized by course ID and lesson name, with tight coupling to an Obsidian vault for course planning and content management.

## Project Structure

This is a RevealJS 5.2.1 repository configured for multiple course presentations. Slides are written in Markdown format with one file per lesson, organized in a flat two-level structure: `course-id/lesson-name`.
